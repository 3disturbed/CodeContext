Overview

CodeContext is a shell-friendly console application designed to facilitate the breakdown of large JavaScript projects (including HTML and CSS files) into manageable context windows. This tool enables AI agents to effectively understand, analyze, and develop complex projects under the supervision of a skilled developer. By leveraging AI, CodeContext ensures efficient project management, detailed code inspection, and collaborative development in remote environments accessed via SSH.
Features

    AI-Powered Code Analysis: Utilize AI agents to provide detailed insights and analysis of the codebase, enhancing understanding and accelerating development.
    Codebase Indexing: Quickly view the structure of your project, organized by modules and files.
    Detail Level Adjustment: Seamlessly switch between different levels of code detail:
        API Data: View basic function signatures, styles, and HTML structure.
        Chunk: Inspect larger chunks of code for a deeper understanding.
        Full: Access the complete source code.
    Context Management: Save the current exploration context into a JSON file to share with team members or for future reference.
    Shell-Friendly: Designed to be used in a command-line interface, making it perfect for SSH use.

Use Cases

    AI-Enhanced Project Development: Ideal for breaking down large projects into manageable parts, allowing AI agents to assist in development while a skilled developer supervises.
    AI-Assisted Code Reviews: Simplifies the process of reviewing specific parts of the codebase by allowing selective detail inspection, enhanced with AI-driven analysis.
    Collaborative Debugging: Share the current state of code exploration with your team using the generated JSON file, and use AI agents to identify and fix issues.
    Learning and Onboarding: New team members can use CodeContext to navigate and learn the codebase more efficiently, with AI-driven guidance.
